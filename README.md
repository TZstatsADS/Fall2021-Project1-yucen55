### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ Projec title: An Analysis on Texts of Feminism Philosophers
+ This project is conducted by Yucen Wang

+ Project summary: This report explores whether feminism philosophers include a large portion of negative sentiments in their articles. The report also looks for the topics that those philosophers care about. I took the [Philosophy data](https://www.kaggle.com/kouroshalizadeh/history-of-philosophy) snd generated random samples to analyze. I applied sentimental analysis and word cloud in this project.

+ Three questions will be answered in this report are:

  i). Do feminists show more irritation and aggressiveness in their words?
  
  ii). How do feminism philosophers' attitudes change over time?
  
  iii). What topics do feminists care about?
